#Notes from the meta-analysis
Add anything you read and deem important.

###Collaboration
Collaboration is key and must be incentivized. (source: https://wiki.snowdrift.coop/market-research/history/software#bounties)
- Tipping is an option
- Virtual currency is an option
- User visibility is key

###Many have tried and failed
e.g. The Free Software Bazaar, CoSource, Fundry, the public software fund, Bounty OSS, BitKick, COFundOS, Opensourcexperts.com, Donorge, Bountycounty, Bounty Hacker, microPledge, FundHub, GitBo, ...

=> We need a simple solution that eliminates the problem of open source software funding. (if there really is a problem)

=> We need clients before we continue development. People who instantly want to use us if we release a beta.
