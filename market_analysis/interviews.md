#Interviews with potential clients of all kind

The goal is to verify that **the problems exist** and that **they need fixing**.
- Problem of the software user: I hate it if my OSS Issues are not adressed / stay open too long.
- Problem of the contributor: I don't want to always work for free.

## How to get interviews
German:

Hallo XXX
    
Wie geht es dir?

Ich bin Teil der Digital Open Innovation Vereinigung Bern. Ich evaluiere gerade die Verwendung von Open Source Software, Gründe und Hindernisse dazu im Raum **Bern**.
Da du dich auch in dieser Branche bewegst, wäre es interessant mit Dir ein kurzes Telefongespräch zu führen.

Hättest Du Zeit und Lust dafür? Wann könnte ich dich erreichen?

Mit bestem Gruss
XXX

English for repository owners: Subject: **Your experience with the XXX-community**
Be sure to check first what form of payment they are receiving.

Hi XXX
I am a user of XXX and love it. :) Thanks for the great work you put into it.
Are you developing this at your job? Do you receive any form of payment for it?
I have thought a lot about the (financial) reward system and the roles necessary to build trust for
a healthy community around an open source project. I would like to talk to open source developers 
and people they work with to learn from their problems.
Would you be interested to tell me about your experiences on skype, appear.in or via email?
Best regards,
Joe

##How to proceed during the interview?
- Ask about the clients experience with OSS?
- Ask **why** he thinks these experiences turned out like this.
- Keep asking why
- Ask how they decide for a specific software?

**If** this validates that there is a problem that needs fixing, continue:
- If you could have offered money to fix that issue you had with software X, would you have done it?
- How much?
- What are the expectations in the system and the process. (e.g fixed after how many days, payment process, ...)

**If** this is more or less what we have already built, show a small demo and ask them whether we can sign them up for beta users.
