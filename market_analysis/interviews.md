#Interviews with potential clients of all kind
The goal is to verify that **the problems exist** and that **they need fixing**.
- Problem of the software user: I hate it if my OSS Issues are not adressed / stay open too long.
- Problem of the contributor: I don't want to always work for free.

Hallo Lukas
    
Wie geht es dir?

Ich bin Teil der Digital Open Innovation Vereinigung Bern. Ich evaluiere gerade die Verwendung von Open Source Software, Gründe und Hindernisse dazu im Raum **Bern**.
Da du dich auch in dieser Branche bewegst, wäre es interessant mit Dir ein kurzes Telefongespräch zu führen.

Hättest Du Zeit und Lust dafür? Wann könnte ich dich erreichen?

Mit bestem Gruss
Joe

##How to proceed during the interview?
- Ask about the clients experience with OSS?
- Ask **why** he thinks these experiences turned out like this.
- Keep asking why
- Ask how they decide for a specific software?

**If** this validates that there is a problem that needs fixing, continue:
- If you could have offered money to fix that issue you had with software X, would you have done it?
- How much?
- What are the expectations in the system and the process. (e.g fixed after how many days, payment process, ...)

**If** this is more or less what we have already built, show a small demo and ask them whether we can sign them up for beta users.
